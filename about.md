This is a customized version of the base Jekyll theme. I've basically kept the HTML architecture pretty much the same but the project now uses Gulp as the build system. This allows for BrowserSync, Autoprefixer, Gulp-Sass and some other cool stuff. I've added some basic animation functionality based on [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/), restructured the Sass folders and also added [Sanitize.css](https://10up.github.io/sanitize.css/) as a more robust reset.

You can use this as a starting point or as is it's totally up to you. To customize the theme further, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation check out [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)
